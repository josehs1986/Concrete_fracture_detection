# Concrete_fracture_detection
Concrete fracture detection based on image processing is a relevant issue in building and civil strutcture maintenance.

Here we address this problems from a methodological point of view, comparing some of the state-of-the-art approaches, based on multiple features extracted from images used for training a large set of classifiers in order to select the best method and best feature set (on notebook CF1), with a quite simple single feature classifier. 
In this problem we found two very simple features obtained by filtering, which independently allows achieving significantly higher scores than the best of the more sophisticated state-of-the-art approach (on notebooks CF2 and CF3).
We used two datasets with 20K images each (resolution 227x277) for unfractured and fractured cases.
